# Network Traffic Analysis

## Objective

The Network Traffic Analysis project aimed to practice analyzing network traffic for suspicious trends and activity, managing and responding to risks that are present in the network. The primary focus was to best guess about what happened and then investigate further to troubleshoot the issue and strengthen the overall security of the network. This generates test to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of packet analysis
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
